# scripts

Collection of scripts that I've written over time to help me automate things, which otherwish would be boring and repetitive. This repo might also contain the scripts that I come across on the Internet, with due credits.

If you think you can make it better, have a suggestion or undue credits or if there is some bug, let me know on Twitter here [@c0dist](https://twitter.com/c0dist). 

Pull requests are welcome.
